# PyBer Analysis Project
An analysis of ride-sharing data for a company called PyBer, a ride-sharing app company.

## Challenge Overview
This challege analysis was to create, with Pandas, a summary DataFram of ride-sharing data corresponding with the type of city it occurred in. Additionally, to leverage Matplotlib to create a graphical visualization reflecting the total weekly fares for each of the community types. 

## Results
Below is a table which examines the different city types (Rural, Suburban, and Urban) and how each has an apparent effect on the number of rides, drivers, and fares in each of those communities. For example, the Average Fare per Ride for Rural type is $34.62 while the more densely populated Urban type has an Average Fare per Ride of $24.53. This is likely due to the distances traveled because Rural communities are typically located far from Surburban and Urban centers. Additionally, when you look at the Average Fare per Driver, we see the same pattern. The more densely populated Urban type has a smaller result when compared to the Rural community. This is a function of population size ultimately. There are much more drivers in Urban areas compared to the smaller Rural areas.

Additionally, below is a chart which helps visualize the stark difference between the city types. While they each appear to follow a similar trend over time, clearly we can see how much the fares are affected by the type of city in which they occurred. As the density of the city grows the more ride-sharing fares result.
